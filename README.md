# Roadie  
**AI Road Companion for Learning**  

Roadie is a hands-on learning project that brings AI and computer vision to the road.  
It runs on a Raspberry Pi 5 connected to a camera and small display, making it a complete platform to explore how AI can detect and display road information in real time.  

## ðŸ“‹ Project Specification  

### Priorities of detection alerts  
The system will always display the highest-priority event currently detected.  
- **Priority 1**: Obstacles (animals, humans, road cracks)  
- **Priority 2**: Police control 
- **Priority 3**: Road signs

### Info Gathering  
These are the **sources of information** that Roadie uses either to display data on the GUI or to improve detection and decision-making:  
- **Google Maps** â€“ provides map data and location context.  
- **Dashboard camera** â€“ real-time video input for object detection.  
- **AI libraries** â€“ models and frameworks used for detecting objects and signs.  
- **Politikontroller app** â€“ integration for reading and writing police control data.  
- **Algorithm** â€“ calculates the chance of being controlled based on driving and external factors.  

### Logs for Future Development
