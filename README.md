# Roadie  
**AI Road Companion for Learning**  

Roadie is a hands-on learning project that brings AI and computer vision to the road.  
It runs on a Raspberry Pi 5 connected to a camera and small display, making it a complete platform to explore how AI can detect and display road information in real time.  

## ðŸ“‹ Project Specification

- Dashboard camera  
- AI libraries  
- Politikontroller app (read & write)  
- Algorithm (chance of being controlled on the road)  

### Layout  
- **Front page**: warnings (2/3), quick access buttons (1/3)  
- **Quick access buttons**:  
  - Button 1: Register control & switch  
  - Button 2: Menu  

### Logs for Future Development
